** now
allow adding attributes
allow editing categories
implement items: items are instances of an obj
double category submit bug
don't show 'thing'/'attributes' in tabs, show '<thing> list' / '<thing> attributes'

** later
attributes have a name and a datatype
full text search (lucene or elasticsearch?)
